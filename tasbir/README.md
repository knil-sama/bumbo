# Purpose

Small project to help me select which vacations picture I should keep

# Issues

Get LOT of pictures from last nepalese trip with lots of redundancy, I want to categorise each pictures into 4 clusters (landscape, portrait, groups, other), then group them by similarity (find duplicates) et apply specific ranking (based on cluster) to find the objectively "best" one.

# TODO

1. Setup project
2. Select 12 pictures for testing (3 for each clusters)
3. ???
4. Profit
